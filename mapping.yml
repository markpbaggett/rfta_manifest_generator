# This metadata mapping follows the IIIF Presentation v.3 specification.  It is written in YAML rather than a
# spreadsheet for ease of conversion and so that there are no suprises between the developers and metadata librarians.


# The top level resource in the response must have the @context property, and it should appear as the very first
# key/value pair of the JSON representation. This tells Linked Data processors how to interpret the document. The value
# of the @context property must be either the URI http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json or a JSON array with
# the URI http://iiif.io/api/presentation/3/context.json as the last item.
